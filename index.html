        <div class="subheading mb-5">Film MakingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Bryan Page, and I'm here to make a change in the world. I feel like music and films hold a special power to this world and I wanna inspire and impact thousands of lives through my films. After I have made a film, I screen them for my friends and get feedback on each film's liked or disliked. Even if I make a film that turned out bad, I always learned something. I ever tried to do something different and try to improve on my next film. I continuously watch tutorials and study different ways to edit effects and transitions. I have taken just about every type of film course offered at my community college to gain knowledge on the history of film and understand why directors, editors, and cinematographers used specific techniques in their work. <br><br>

          My greatest talent or skill in majoring in film is my creativity and studying the film industry's different aspects. It is essential as a filmmaker; whether one plans to work as a director, producer, or behind the scenes, you should understand what it takes to make a film from start to finish. I have made several short films. I have a good understanding of every part of the filmmaking process: includes the camerawork, lighting, sound, special effects, design, and the post-production processes. I've created any project, I always ensure to make it aesthetically pleasing since people often judge with their eyes recreationally. I love doing photography to capture tangible memories. I've even modeled for a good handful of inspiring photographers and found out that visual arts like pictures and videos are truly worth a thousand words, and there is a story in everything. I aspire that my creativity will someday affect others, and it makes me always motivated to learn. I aim to impact, strive to share, and look to discover. Problem solving and communication also skills that I possess. Filmmaking is not easy and does not always go according to plan. Sometimes I encounter obstacles that require problem-solving. I feel that I have good analytical and problem skills to identify and resolve the issue to keep moving forward when making films. I even used to help out and make videos for my school. I helped out making videos for the school's high school track team and football team. I've gained a good reputation as one of the most excellent filmmakers in the city of Simi Valley. Even a fair amount of music artists talked to me about directing, recording, and editing music videos for them. <br><br>

          I've learned that "talent" is something you build on and develop, not something you simply display to the world and try to coast to success on. What makes a person a strong candidate is that they believe in their own ability. I learned having a mentality of "that's too hard, or I'm not smart or good enough," you're not going to go anywhere or reach past your full potential. Life is not perfect, and we are all dealt different hands, but I feel that nothing is too hard if you put your mind to it and want it.
